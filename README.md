RU HACKS 2020 SUBMISSION 

TEAM: H0T B0Y5 MEMBERS: CHRISTOPHER SHIM, JAOWAD SHAH, FARAZ JAMIL, NICOLAS LOUIE

This git repository stores the final commit for our RU HACKS 2020 submission. The application, Recipe Finder, utilizes the Spoonacular API (https://spoonacular.com/) and the Google Cloud suite of products (https://cloud.google.com/); App Engine for deploying the web app, and Vision API to implement computer vision.

This is a submission for the Google Cloud competition category, and is noted in the DevPost submission by Faraz Jamil. This project utilized Python (Flask) and HTML using UIKit.

The web link to access the final hackathon commit is https://recipefinder-277507.ue.r.appspot.com/.

To utilize the app, please visit the link above. The home page appears first. Click on the SEARCH button to search recipes by keywords manually inputted, separated by commas, and the amount of recipes desired. Click on the UPLOAD button to upload pictures to generate recipe results. The file must be chosen in the machine's file explorer; please note this function may be buggy. If the deployment link does not work, the html files are provided in this repository.

Please note that there may still be bugs, as this was a project completed in a short amount of time with little knowledge of Python, HTML and GCloud suite products by most members.
